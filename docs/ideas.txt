REV: OK, for NSIMer4

Basically simple engine for simulating for SC experiments before full version.


1) Encapsulate in class...
2) Have list of (pointers?) to GPU side
3) Use GPU for sorting and for random generation of circuit. Asynchronously write back to file to check it?
4) Use for loops within neurons/items
5) Use kernel within kernel for each group? I.e. to build total kernel of updates. Kernel call takes non-insignificant time.
   Only issue would be if we wanted to use different "size" of kernel e.g. blocks etc.
6) Allow sanity checking on CPU as well. I.e. use same STARTING VALUES/PARAMS/CIRCUIT.
7) Neuron groups with specific functions?
8) Derivations from "classes" (components). I.e. overload same conductance to be AMPA/GABAa/GABAb/etc.
